# Introduction 

Tic-Tac-Toe is one of the paper-and-pencil games. This game requires two players in 3x3 grid with Player 1 acts as “O” and Player 2 acts as “X”, or vice versa. The objective of this game is to take place of three connecting grids in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal way.
This game was first introduced  at ancient time,  however there is no evidence  who invented it and which  year. Some people think  this game was  invented at  Ancient Egypt, and then Roman Empire called this game “Terni Lapili”. The grid drawing for the game had been found chalked all over the ancient city’s ruins. Terni Lapili was resurfaced in England with the name “Nought and Crosses” in 1864. This resurfaced version is the modern of Tic-Tac-Toe game that people know until this present day.
In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC computer at University of Cambridge developed a computerized Tic-Tac-Toe game called “OXO”. This was the first video game of Tic-Tac-Toe and  it has AI inside,  therefore  human  could play  against the computer opponent.

# Game Strategy 

Tic-Tac-Toe game has many strategies that can be used. 
The main point of the strategy is  the  players  have  to  block the  opponent  fork,  either  horizontally,  vertically,  or diagonally, while the players have to find their own fork to win.  
In combinatorial study, suppose “X” moves first, then the game is won as follows:
• 91 distinct positions are won by X.
• 44 distinct position are won by O.
• 3 distinct positions are draw.

## Theory Of Game

   A)Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game. 
   B) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.
   In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, thegame results a tie.
   Hence there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent(human or computer) wins or it’s a tie.
